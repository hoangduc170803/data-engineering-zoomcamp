# Data-Engineering-Zoomcamp

## Overview

This project is part of my learning journey following the Data Zoomcamp course. It serves as a hands-on practice for data engineering concepts, including data ingestion, transformation, storage, and analysis. The goal is to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios by building data pipelines and working with cloud technologies.
